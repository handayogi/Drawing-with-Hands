# Drawing with Hands

> Multimedia Technology Course at Sumatera Institute of Technology (ITERA)

This project allows users to draw on video frames in real-time using hand gestures as input. The project uses Python Libraries such as `OpenCV`, `MediaPipe`, and `NumPy`.
The application detect hands and fingers movement, allowing users to create and manipulate lines directly on the video frames. Additionally, the program includes features
to change the line color and erase drawings using specific hand gestures. It offers an interactive and intuitive way to engage with real-time video processing through simple fingers movements.

## Library explanation:
- `Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV)` is an open-source library that use for image and video processing.  
- `MediaPipe` is a library framework used for AI-based multimedia data processing solutions such as hand, face, and body detection.  
- `NumPy` is a library for efficient numerical computation.
